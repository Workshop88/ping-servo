#DualPing2Servo - 2 ultrasonic transducers driving 2 servos
***
This is a quick Arduino sketch to use two HC-SR04-type cheap ultrasonic "ping" distance sensors to control two servos via the standard Servo library.

The intended application was an X-Y tiltable table for a game consisting of box with a hole and a golf ball for a local Maker Faire.  Tilt the table to drop the ball in the hole.
